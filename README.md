- 👋 Hi, I’m @chuckmilam here and on most other platforms.
- 👀 I’m interested in using technology to eliminate toil and human error. Automate all the things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about DevSecOps every day. At home, I'm considering deploying my own Kubernetes clusters on ~~Raspberry Pis~~ whatever hardware I can scrounge up these days, because who can find a Pi anymore?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others who want to innovate while maintaining compliance boundaries.
- 📫 How to reach me?  Start here.
