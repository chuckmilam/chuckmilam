- 👋 Hi, I’m @chuckmilam here and on most of the usual platforms.
- 👀 I’m interested in using technology to take care of toil.  Automate all the things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Ansible and Elasticsearch every day, while studying for that next certifcation exam.  At home, I'm considering deploying my own Kubernetes cluster on Raspberry Pis, because I need yet another hobby.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others who want to innovate while staying inside compliance boundaries.
- 📫 How to reach me?  Well, here is a good start!
