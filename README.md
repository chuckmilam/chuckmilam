- 👋 Hi, I’m @chuckmilam here and on most other platforms.
- 👀 I’m interested in using technology to handle toil. Automate all the things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about DevSecOps every day, while studying for that next certifcation exam. At home, I'm considering deploying my own Kubernetes cluster on ~~Raspberry Pis~~ whatever hardware I can scrounge up these days, because I need yet another hobby.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others who want to innovate while staying inside compliance boundaries.
- 📫 How to reach me?  Well, here is a good start!
